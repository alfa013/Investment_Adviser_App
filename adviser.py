    As an expert financial analyst, generate a comprehensive investment report for {company_name} ({stock_info.get('symbol', '')}).
    The target audience is an investor with a **{risk}** risk tolerance.

    **Current Data:**
    - **Latest Closing Price:** ${latest_price:.2f}
    - **Market Cap:** ${stock_info.get('marketCap', 0):,}
    - **P/E Ratio:** {stock_info.get('trailingPE', 'N/A'):.2f}

    - **52-Week Low:** ${stock_info.get('fiftyTwoWeekLow', 0):.2f}
    - **Technical Situation:** {tech_situation}
    - **Recent News Sentiment:** {sentiment_situation} (Score: {sentiment:.2f})

    **Task:**
    Based on the data above and the investor's {risk} risk profile, provide a detailed report.
    Structure the report with the following Markdown sections:
    - `### Executive Summary` (A brief, high-level recommendation and overview).
    - `### Technical Analysis` (Elaborate on the moving averages and what they imply).
    - `### Sentiment Analysis` (Discuss the news sentiment and its potential impact).
    - `### Risk Assessment` (Analyze the potential risks, specifically tailored to a {risk} risk tolerance investor).
    - `### Final Recommendation` (Provide a concluding paragraph with a clear course of action).

    The tone should be professional, balanced, and strictly informational. Do not give financial advice, but rather an expert analysis based on the provided data.
